# Modelling with Differential Equations
These files provide an entire set of notes and problem sheets for a course in Modelling With Differential Equations. The course covers topics such as constitutive laws, steady states and linear stability of Ordinary Differential Equations systems.

These notes were written by Dr Thomas E. Woolley. They are not based on a specific book, but rather the culmination of being taught by a diverse range of undergraduate lecturers. As such, input is acknowledged from lecturers David Acheson, Paul Todd, Chris Davies, Philip Maini, Ruth Baker and Eamonnn Gaffney. Sincere apologies to anyone who has been off this list.
